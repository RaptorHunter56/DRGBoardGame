## Introduction
Deep Rock Galactic is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed by Ghost Ship Games. The official board game, designed by Martin Grip and released by Steamforged Games, brings the action and excitement of the video game to your tabletop.

DRGBoardGame is a digital recreation of this board game and its expansions. It serves as a fun project, allowing me to play with my friends overseas, and as an opportunity for me to learn Unreal Engine 5 development.
